Theme Switcher Reloaded is an updated and much improved version of the original Theme Switcher. Comes with a widget and can also switch themes via URL.

== Description ==

Theme Switcher Reloaded was sponsored by Themebot for use with the demos in the [WordPress Themes](http://themebot.com/wordpress-themes "WordPress Themes") section on themebot.com. Coding was initially done by kingler of 72pines and the plugin is maintained by Themebot. This is an optimized version of the venerable themeswitcher by Ryan Boren and Theme Switcher Widget by Jared Bangs. TSR adds new features and enhancements. Language files for Esperanto, Italian and Chinese have been contributed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `theme-switcher-reloaded` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Activate the widget in the 'Appearance' menu, set options and save.
4. If you only want to use the URL switching functionality, you may deactivate the widget after saving options but you must set options once after installation for the plugin to be active.
